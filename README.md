# MyValentine_day1

This is my first Valentine art in this repo.

I made this as a poem that would express how i feel right now.

Its a little melancholic but its a little simple in design.

i wanted to use react for this but deploying a react would be a hassle.

i wanted to use this as a collection for Daj Tech landing page.


I know its not february but i want to take a few day off from coding.

And the second challenge may take 3 days to code so i will be interrupting the start of the day.

Im not a designer by the way so it would really take time to make those things.


The music is from my favorite kdrama couple.

Credits to the real composer and to R3 in youtube.
